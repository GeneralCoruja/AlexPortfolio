                    <p class="description txt-medium">I’ve always been drawn to the arts, largely thanks to my dad, who was
                        incredibly skilled at
                        drawing and would create illustrations for me throughout my childhood. Initially, I aspired to
                        become an architect, which led me to study Visual Arts in high school. However, I soon
                        discovered a passion for digital design after creating a few flyers for an assignment.
                        </br></br>Despite this newfound interest, I wasn’t entirely sure which area of design resonated
                        with me the most. To explore my path further, I pursued a broader degree in Art & Design,
                        allowing me to refine my creative direction.
                        </br></br>I was then released into the wild west of the job market.</p>

                    <p class="description txt-medium">The first few years of my career took me outside my area of expertise, with
                        jobs that involved
                        selling overpriced clothing—but in the end, it all worked out! Those experiences helped me
                        develop valuable soft skills in communication and gave me the confidence to interact with
                        clients, something I had been lacking before.
                        </br></br>My first job in design led me to move to Castelo Branco—a city of extreme
                        temperatures—where I focused on branding, logo design, and gave my first baby steps into web
                        design. Now, I’m back in my hometown, working as a UI/UX designer—something I never expected to
                        love as much as I do!
                        </br></br>That’s my (very) short story (for your attention span’s sake). Be part of what’s next
